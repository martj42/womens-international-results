Context

This is a work-in-progress sister data set to the men's international football results dataset. If you're interested in helping out, submit a pull request here.

Content

Currently, the dataset includes 11,020 women's international football results. All major tournament results should be complete. Some international friendlies, particularly tournaments, are included. A LOT of results are not yet in the dataset.

results.csv includes the following columns:

    date - date of the match
    home_team - the name of the home team
    away_team - the name of the away team
    home_score - full-time home team score including extra time, not including penalty-shootouts
    away_score - full-time away team score including extra time, not including penalty-shootouts
    tournament - the name of the tournament
    city - the name of the city/town/administrative unit where the match was played
    country - the name of the country where the match was played
    neutral - TRUE/FALSE column indicating whether the match was played at a neutral venue

Acknowledgements

The data is gathered from several sources including but not limited to Wikipedia, fifa.com, rsssf.com and individual football associations' websites.

Inspiration

Some directions to take when exploring the data:

    Who is the best team of all time
    Which teams dominated different eras of football
    What trends have there been in international football throughout the ages - home advantage, total goals scored, distribution of teams' strength etc
    Can we say anything about geopolitics from football fixtures - how has the number of countries changed, which teams like to play each other
    Which countries host the most matches where they themselves are not participating in
    How much, if at all, does hosting a major tournament help a country's chances in the tournament
    Which teams are the most active in playing friendlies and friendly tournaments - does it help or hurt them

The world's your oyster, my friend.
